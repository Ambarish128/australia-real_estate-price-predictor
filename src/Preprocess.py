"""
Main script to process raw real estate data files and produce a cleaned CSV.

Steps:
1. Parse all raw .DAT files from the 'data/raw' directory into a single DataFrame.
2. Clean and filter the data to focus on top suburbs.
3. (Optional) Calculate distance to Sydney CBD (currently commented out).
4. Save the cleaned and filtered data as a CSV file for further processing.
